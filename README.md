# GuessingGame

I created a Guessing game using Python coding language on Jupyter Notebook platform.
This game is made using 'random' library and mainly focuses on the usage of 'while' loop and 'if - elif - else' conditional statements.
It is just a one turn game which will tell you if you guessed a number that is close to the random number picked up by the game or the number is far away from the random number.
